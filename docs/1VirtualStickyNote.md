# Virtual Sticky Note

This file is for me to have a place to plan, edit/draft prompts, note information and anything else I would other wise use a notebook/sticky note for. It is constantly changing and should not be considered


### Remaining features to implement:

	1.	Chat-based session creation
	2.	Wrong-answer → open notes
	3.	Target-weaknesses mode
	4.	Mastery tracking updates
	5.	Special resources
	6.	Mathpix UI polish

Plus new idea:
	7.	Guided “note coach” flow (iterative grading of your own explanation → saved as user_notes_mmd)
