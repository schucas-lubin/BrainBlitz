# Virtual Sticky Note

This file is for me to have a place to plan, edit/draft prompts, note information and anything else I would other wise use a notebook/sticky note for. It is constantly changing and should not be considered


### Debugging and testing the ai features:
(switched to codex 5.1 from composer when issues began arising)

Composer failed, codex reviewed the summary composer wrote ab what it did and found issues/discrepancies between code/plan/summary...


Tests codex suggested:
1. Job 1 sanity: test the topic-tree endpoint via terminal
done, the supabase api keys were messed up and blocking things, topic tree is now loading  

2. Job 2 sanity: test content generation via terminal

3. DB verification via Supabase (web UI, not terminal)
